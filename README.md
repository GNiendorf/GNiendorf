Current Projects:

- [Line Segment Tracking (LST)](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw): LST is a highly parallelizable tracking algorithm written in C++, now integrated into CMSSW, built to reconstruct tracks from particle collisions in the CMS detector at CERN. It aims to replace the current Kalman Filter-based algorithms with a new GPU-based approach to handle the increased volume of data expected from the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC).
  
Past Projects:
- [TracePy](https://github.com/GNiendorf/tracepy): TracePy is a sequential ray tracing package that I wrote in Python 3 for designing optical systems in the geometric optics regime. It features lens optimization from Scipy. I also developed a [parallelizable version](https://github.com/GNiendorf/Tracepy-Fast) of TracePy written in C++ that is capable of running on GPU's.
- [Light Dark Matter eXperiment (LDMX)](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw): LDMX is a proposed particle physics experiment led by a group at Stanford designed to search for low-mass dark matter. I developed the experiment's background rejection model with XGBoost while as an undergrad at UC Santa Barbara under Joe Incandela.
